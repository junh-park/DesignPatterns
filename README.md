# DesignPatterns

# Purpose of this Repo
As design patterns are the best way to apply and learn the fundamentals of OOP and Java, various examples are added to familiarise myself with them.

The example references are from many different sources such as Head First Design pattern and online forums. I will be adding more patterns if encountered in the future.
